Yes, the "IMAGENB" pdf should be correct for FU2.  I've attached the last
version I have for corresponding files for the baseline scans; the parameters
should be identical to the follow up for those scans that were in both
(but note that there were various tasks which were modified during the
baseline scanning, and various "optional" sequences included at different
points, so I'm not sure how representative these descriptions are of all
the scans, sorry).
